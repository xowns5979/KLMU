									About the DepartmentIntroductionIntroduction
Welcome to KAIST Biological Sciences Web Site.
The Department of Biological Sciences at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), which is the first research-based comprehensive science and engineering educational institute in Korea, offers comprehensive research system as well as undergraduate and graduate programs in the cutting-edge fields of biological sciences. We pursue to conduct research in various fields of biological science and engineering at the top quality worldwide. Indeed, our department has been selected for providing the best research program in our nation by the Brain Korea 21 initiatives of Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development since 1999.<br><br>

In 1972, our department, with an aim to promote both fields of biological science and engineering, was founded and originally named as the Department of Biological Science and Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS), which only had graduate programs. Since its establishment, our department has played a significant role as a hall of learning, spreading the latest biotechnologies to the community. Thirteen years later, in 1985, the undergraduate course in Korea Institute of Technology was opened, and was merged with the graduate program of KAIS in 1990, and thereafter grew as a comprehensive educational department. Recently, the Medical Science Interdisciplinary Program and the Nano-Technology Interdisciplinary Program were created to provide students with much more disciplinary majors to choose from. <br><br>

The undergraduate and graduate curricula in our department are finely organized for students to build a creative research capability and thus to become prominent biological scientists who can play a leading role in the advancement of biological science and technology. Currently, our department has 35 excellent faculty members and modern research facilities, and conducts the cutting-edge research mainly focusing on the two advanced technologies, genomics and nano-technology. In particular, emphasis is placed on research including human diseases and their molecular mechanisms, functional genomics and its application, and nano-biotechnologies and their application.<br><br>
